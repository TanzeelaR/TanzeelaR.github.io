    <h1>My Design Manifesto</h1>
    <p id="lineOne">You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are</p>
    <p id="lineTwo">When you're lying in my arms, baby
    </p>
    <p id="lineThree">You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
    </p>
    <p id="linefour">Or faster than my fastest cars
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id="linefive">I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter</p>
    <p id="linesix">You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better</p>
    <p id="lineseven">I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing</p>
    <p id="lineeight">I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter</p>
    <p id="linenine">You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better</p>
    <p id="lineten">I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing</p>
    <p id="lineeleven">Oh, I'll pick you up
        if you come back to America, just hit me up</p>
    <p id="linetwelve">'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side</p>
    <p id="linethirteen">If you come back to California, you should just hit me up</p>
    <p id="linefourteen">We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far</p>
