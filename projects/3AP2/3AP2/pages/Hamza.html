    <h1>Hamza...
    </h1>


    <p>
        I've been away from home on and off all my life and it gets difficult. Even today it's not easy having no time to even rest your eyes at the end of the day. So for me, home has always been the little things.
        <br>
        <br>
        Amma's embrace after a long while away from home, discussion with baba on a topic we're both interested in, his entirely different approach which opens my eyes to his brilliance and excellence.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's Noor's little things that she does, it's Sulaima's doing something sweet even though none of us asked for it, it's Khuzaima being cute just because she is.
        <br>
        <br>
        All the little things which inadvertently show love in its purest most selfless form. The form we don't appreciate in the moment but the form we long after we lose it. Loss is love when it's present.
