    <h1>Maybe home isn’t a place, maybe it is...</h1>
    <p>Home has always been just a place for most of us. A tangible <br> structure built by stacking bricks and mortar. This website is about <br>a subculture where home isn’t a piece of land or a house it is all <br>the little things. Here, home can be anything in the world. It can be the shared comfort of a warm blanket with your loved one, a cup of<br> coffee with a friend, or a Sunday morning tussle for the newspaper <br>with your furry friend. Maybe home isn’t a place, maybe it isn’t made <br>up bricks and cement or drywall or soil, home has really less to do <br>with a piece of soil than, you could say, with a piece of soul.
