    <h1>Two</h1>

    <p>Today, like every other day,
        <br>
        we wake up empty and frightened.
        <br>
        <br>
        Don’t open the door to the study and begin reading.
        <br>
        Take down a musical instrument.
        <br>
        <br>
        Let the beauty we love
        <br>
        be what we do.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are hundreds of ways <br> to kiss the ground.
        <br>
        <br>

    </p>

    <p>Today we’re broken down,
        <br>
        broken, like every other day,

        <br>
        <br>
        don’t open the door of worry,
        <br>
        grab the rubab and play!
        <br>
        <br>
        There’s one hundred prayers
        <br>
        and prostrations
        <br>
        <br>
        for one who faces the beauty of
        <br>
        their beloved when they pray.
        <br>
        <br>
