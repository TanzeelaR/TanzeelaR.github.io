    <p>This website is about decolonising and reclaiming poetry by Rumi.

        Jalaluddin Rumi was a 13th-century Persian poet, Islamic scholar and Sufi mystic. Rumi is one of the best selling poets in the US and his translated works are everywhere. It is undeniable that Rumi was a Muslim scholar and took Islam seriously, his works revolve aorund his love for God and his book "Masnavi" is the greatest example.
