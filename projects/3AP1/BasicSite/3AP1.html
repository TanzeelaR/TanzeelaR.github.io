    <h1>Reclaiming Rumi</h1>

    <p>This website is about decolonising and reclaiming poetry by Rumi. Jalaluddin Rumi was a 13th-century Persian poet, faqih, Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic.

        <br>
        Coleman Barks, the man who made his career translating Rumi's poetry, hadn't studied any of these subjects and could event read Persian.
        Until now any poetry you've seen by Rumi has been an interpretation of his poetry and is very far away from the essence of what Rumi was trying to convey.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are some accurate translations of his poetry:
